## 🧪 Experience in Software Testing

Before transitioning into DevOps, I worked as a **Software Testing Engineer**, where I gained hands-on experience in:

- ✅ Writing and executing test cases (manually)
- 🧪 Using tools like **Postman**, and **JMeter**
- 📋 Creating detailed test plans and bug reports
- 🔁 Collaborating closely with developers to ensure high-quality releases

This background helps me design better pipelines with testing in mind — from automated test integration to performance and regression testing in CI/CD workflows.
